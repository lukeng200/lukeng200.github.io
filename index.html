  <h2 class="featurette-heading">About </h2>
  <p class="lead">
  I graduated from an Erasmus Mundus Joint Master Degree in 
  <a href = "https://wacoma.unibo.it/promotion_dissemination.php"> Water and Coastal Management</a>, fully funded by the European Union, and hosted by the University of Bologna (Italy), the University of Cadiz (Spain), and the University of Algarve (Portugal). In Italy, the programme is recognised as the international curriculum of the second cycle degree in Environmental Assessment and Management. Additionally, I hold a bachelor's degree in Water Resources Management with a major in Hydrology from the Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta, Nigeria, fully sponsored by my parents. I made a successful scale through, with 110/110 honour from the University of Bologna, as well as first class honour (4.60/5.00) as per my undergraduate degree. As a matter of fact, I have demonstrated to be a consistent student even though there are changes in the system of education in different countries.

  My current research is focused on Statiscal Analysis of Coastal Drainage Data in relation to Climate Change and Extreme Events in the Low-Lying Coastal Watersheds, supervised by
  <a href = "https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/m.antonellini/en"> Marco Antonellini</a> and 
  <a href = "https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/beatrice.giambastiani/en"> Prof. B.M. Giambiastini</a> 
<br/>
<br/>
My programme is fully supported by the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/node_en">European Union</a> through the University of Bologna.
