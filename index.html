  <p class="lead">
  I recently graduated from an Erasmus Mundus Joint Master Degree in 
  <a href = "https://wacoma.unibo.it/promotion_dissemination.php"> Water and Coastal Management </a>, fully funded by the European Union, and hosted by the University of Bologna (Italy), the University of Cadiz (Spain), and the University of Algarve (Portugal). In Italy, the programme is recognised as the international curriculum of the second cycle degree in 
  <a href = "https://www.unibo.it/en/teaching/degree-programmes/programme/2014/8418"> Environmental Assessment and Management</a>. Additionally, I hold a bachelor's degree in Water Resources Management with a major in Hydrology from the Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta, Nigeria, fully sponsored by my parents. I made a successful scale through, with 110/110 honour from the University of Bologna, as well as first class honour (4.60/5.00) as per my undergraduate degree. As a matter of fact, I have demonstrated to be a consistent student even though there are changes in the system of education in different countries </a>.

  My background, interest, and focus have always been about earth sciences subjects such as geography, water resources management, river science, and hydrology. The need to understand how water and related issues are managed and tackled in developed countries prompted me to seek a new challenge abroad (MSc Sojourn). In the quest of learning, I acquired skill sets in statistical methods and models, R and Python programming, analytical techniques, remote sensing systems, and more. These techniques have become excellent tools for me to explore solutions to different water problems. While conducting my master's research, I employed some of these methods (that is, statistical methods and models, and GIS spatial analysis) to unravel different natural and/or anthropogenic processes affecting long-term coastal water drainage: with implications for water management.
